# 3D-Discovery
When you set up the raspberry pi for this prototype, you need to go into the configurations of the pi and make sure that the serial port is enabled and serial console is disabled. This setting is under Main Menu > Preferences > Raspberry Pi configuration > Interfaces. If serial port is disabled then the python serial class cannot be used and if serial console is enabled then the pi will not receive the correct data from the transceivers.
